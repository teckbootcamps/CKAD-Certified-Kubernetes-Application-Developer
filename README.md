## CKAD Exam Practice Labs

The best way to prepare is to practice a lot! The setups below will provide you with a Kubernetes cluster where you can perform all the required practice. The CKAD exam expects you to solve problems on a live cluster.

> **Note:** CKAD does not include any multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Hands-on practice is essential!

### Recommended Practice Tools

1. [**Killercoda**](https://killercoda.com): An online interactive platform to practice Kubernetes and other DevOps tools in a realistic environment.
2. [**Minikube**](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io): A tool that lets you run a Kubernetes cluster locally, ideal for individual practice on your local machine.
